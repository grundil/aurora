			<p><strong>A bestiary of wondrous friends and foes for the world’s greatest roleplaying game.</strong></p>
			<p>Sparkling with the musings of the wizard Mordenkainen, this tome features a host of creatures for use in the Dungeons &amp Dragons roleplaying game. Hailing from every corner of the multiverse, these creatures represent some of the most benevolent and malevolent forces that D&ampD heroes might face.</p>
			<p>The book also gathers together fantastical peoples from many different worlds. Each of these peoples represents a race option when you create your D&ampD character, expanding on the choices in the Player’s Handbook.</p>
